JSON API steps for Cucumber, hand-crafted for you in Juke \*nod to Aruba\*


Getting Started

TODO
----

* Add gem dependencies: cucumber, rack, rack-test
* Comparing hashes should ignore whether it's a symbol or string (HashWithIndifferentAccess)
* Should assertions be framework independent?
* Need "Getting Started" or examples
* http adapter would be awesome
