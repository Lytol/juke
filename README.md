Juke
====

JSON API steps for Cucumber, hand-crafted for you in Juke \*nod to Aruba\*


Getting Started
---------------




TODO
----

* Use a generator to produce the step definitions (like pickle)
* The generator should also generate a support file "features/support/juke" with default require and config
* Debug configuration option
* Do not require files that require cucumber when 'gem "juke"'

* Add gem dependencies: cucumber, rack, rack-test
* Comparing hashes should ignore whether it's a symbol or string (HashWithIndifferentAccess)
* Should assertions be framework independent?
* Need "Getting Started" or examples
* http adapter would be awesome
